[Yagni](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) - You Aren't Gonna Need It.

No matter how it happens, sooner or later an application is going to end up
with dead code. It's time to call Yagni, the exterminator. Begone,
uncertainty about the usefulness of things!

This plugin is a static code analyzer. It works by identifying all of the 
interned vars in the namespaces findable within your `:source-paths`, and
then walking the forms of those vars.

As it walks the forms, it builds a graph of references to other vars. It then
searches the graph from a set of entrypoints (by default your project's
`:main` method), and emits warnings for any vars that it couldn't find in the
graph's search.

## Installation

Merge the following into your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/yagni "0.1.0"]]}}
```

## Usage

To have Yagni search for dead code, just run:

    $ lein yagni

## Examples

Running `lein yagni` on the sample project located [here](https://github.com/venantius/yagni-test) will emit the following output:

```
$ lein yagni
=================== WARNING: Parents ======================
== Could not find any references to the following vars. ===
===========================================================

secondns/func-the-second

================== WARNING: Children ======================
== The following vars have references to them, but their ==
== parents do not.                                       ==
===========================================================

secondns/notafunc
```

## Configuration

By default, Yagni assumes that the only entrypoint for your project is the one
listed in your project.clj's `:main` key. Obviously, this is only useful for
applications and tools with CLI invocations.

As libraries, multi-main programs, and certain other types of projects either
tend to have no `:main` or many entrypoint methods, you can instead enumerate
a list of entrypoints for your project in a `.lein-yagni` file in the root 
directory of your project. Feel free to take a look at the one in this project
as an example.

## Contributing

In general, bug reports, fixes, and code cleanup are always appreciated. 
Feature requests are liable to be subject to a bit more discussion. 

When filing issues, please include the following:

 * The operating system
 * The JDK version
 * The Leiningen version
 * The Clojure version
 * Any plugins and dependencies in your `project.clj` and your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`
