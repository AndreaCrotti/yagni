# Yagni

No matter how it happens, sooner or later an application is going to end up
with dead code. It's time to call Yagni, the exterminator.

Yagni works by identifying all interned vars in the namespaces findable
within your `:source-paths`, and then walking all interned forms in those
namespaces to find references to those vars. 

It emits warnings for any vars for which it can't find any references outside
the var's own declaration.

## Installation

Merge the following into your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[venantius/yagni "0.1.0"]]}}
```

## Usage

To have Yagni search for unused code, just run:

    $ lein yagni check
